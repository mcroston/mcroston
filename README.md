## Hi, I'm Merriah Croston!

- I’m a PhD student in the Public Health Sciences program at Washington University in St. Louis. 
- I study health information and health behavior diffusion with an emphasis on social media contexts.
- Current projects use social network methods to examine COVID-19 misinformation diffusion compared to other information types on Twitter. 
- I look to collaborate with scholars with interest in influence, information or behavior diffusion, and/or social media.
