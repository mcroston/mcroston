## Hi, I'm Merriah Croston!

- I’m a PhD student in the Public Health Sciences program at Washington University in St. Louis. 
- I study how and why health misinformation spreads on social media. 
- Current projects use social network analysis and visualization to examine COVID-19 misinformation diffusion on Twitter. 
- I'm interested in cross-disciplinary collaborations with experts in information science, communications, digital humanities, and critical media studies.
